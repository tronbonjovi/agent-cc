# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Theme aesthetic profiles** — each theme now controls glow intensity, border radius, card elevation style, gradient mesh opacity, and animation scale via `ThemeAesthetic` type. Themes feel native instead of "same app, different paint"
- **Anthropic light variant** — Anthropic theme rewritten as a warm cream light theme (#faf9f5 backgrounds) matching the Claude desktop aesthetic. No glows, soft corners, warm shadows
- **4 new community themes** — Rosé Pine, Tomorrow Night, Oceanic Next, One Half Dark. Total: 13 themes
- **Multi-theme system** — registry-based architecture with 5 named themes (Dark, Light, Glass, Anthropic, Catppuccin Mocha) plus system auto-detect. Each theme is a standalone definition file; adding a new theme requires one file and one line in the registry
- **Catppuccin Mocha theme** — soothing pastel dark theme from the official Catppuccin palette
- **Theme dropdown picker** — replaces the old cycle button in the sidebar with a dropdown showing color swatches and checkmarks. Full WAI-ARIA accessibility: keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader support
- **Theme-aware entity colors** — entity type colors (project, mcp, plugin, skill, markdown, config) now use CSS variables and adapt per theme across all page components
- **Theme-aware decorative CSS** — gradient mesh background, glass utilities, gradient borders, status panels, section headers, text gradients, and box shadows all respond to theme changes
- **Light-variant extensibility** — `data-variant` attribute on `<html>` allows theme-specific CSS rules to apply to any theme of the same variant, not just a specific theme ID
- **Community themes** — Nord, Dracula, Tokyo Night, and Solarized Dark with accurate palettes from official specs
- **Extended theme tokens** — brand gradient (brand-1/brand-2), nav-active highlight, semantic status colors (success/warning/error), info accent, and optional per-theme font families
- **Theme-aware sidebar** — brand icon, nav active indicators, and all sidebar accents now fully respond to theme changes

### Changed
- Theme state managed via React context (ThemeProvider) instead of independent hook instances
- Entity colors in tailwind.config.ts changed from hardcoded hex to CSS variable references
- Box shadows in tailwind.config.ts changed from hardcoded rgba to CSS variable references
- Border radius in tailwind.config.ts now reads from `--card-radius` CSS variable (sharp/medium/soft per theme)
- Gradient mesh opacity, neon glows, card hover shadows, and brand-glow all driven by per-theme aesthetic tokens
- Decorative animations disabled for themes with `animationScale: "minimal"` via `data-animation` attribute
- 1781 tests across 19 test files, all passing

### Fixed
- **Project key decoding** — added `encodeProjectKey()` for deterministic path-to-key matching, replacing lossy `decodeProjectKey()` in all comparison callsites. Fixes ghost project entries, broken entity linking, and missing session data for hyphenated project names (e.g. "claude-command-center" was showing as "Center")
- **Ghost project deduplication** — projects discovered via filesystem and session key fallback are now deduplicated by encoded key, preferring paths that exist on disk
- **Container directory filtering** — extra scan paths that are containers (e.g. `~/dev/projects`) are no longer treated as projects themselves
- **Docker project discovery** — added `EXTRA_PROJECT_DIRS` env var so the scanner can find host project directories mounted into the container
- **Dashboard API count mismatch** — removed `config` entity from dashboard stat cards (was mislabeled as "API", showing 1 while the APIs page showed 0). Config entities now correctly labeled "Config" and route to Settings
- **Editable app name** — removed click-to-rename on the sidebar app name; it's now a static display
- **MEMORY.md frontmatter false positives** — all MEMORY.md index files are now excluded from frontmatter checks, not just the first one found. Fixes false "missing frontmatter" warnings for multi-project setups
- **Update system fork support** — update checker now prefers `upstream` remote over `origin`, so forked repos check the source project for updates instead of their own fork. UI shows which remote is being used
