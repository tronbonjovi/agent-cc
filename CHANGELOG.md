## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Task management** — project-level task boards with kanban view, drag-and-drop, and markdown-based task files. Tasks are stored as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter in `{project}/.claude/tasks/`, following the same pattern as skills and memories. Features: flexible hierarchy (roadmap → milestone → task or any user-defined structure), customizable statuses/types/priorities, rich task cards with priority colors and description preview, slide-out detail panel, inline task creation, and board setup flow for new projects
- **Task API** — full CRUD endpoints at `/api/tasks/` with optimistic concurrency control, atomic file writes, column reorder, and board config management
- **Task sidebar navigation** — Tasks appears as a sub-item under Projects in the sidebar, with project picker and hierarchy tree

### Changed
- 1883 tests across 21 test files, all passing
- New npm dependencies: `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@dnd-kit/utilities` for drag-and-drop

- Caddy subdomain changed from `ccc.devbox` to `acc.devbox`
- Removed MIT license, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, and other public open-source artifacts
- Reset version to 2.0.0 to mark the clean break
