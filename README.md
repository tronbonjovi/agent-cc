---

A local dashboard for visualizing and managing your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) ecosystem. Auto-discovers your projects, MCP servers, skills, plugins, sessions, agents, and their relationships with zero configuration.

### Why?

- **"How much am I spending on Claude Code?"** -- Cost analytics by session, project, model, and day. See exactly where your tokens go.
- **"Which MCP servers are configured where?"** -- Auto-discovers every `.mcp.json` across all projects. One view, zero setup.
- **"I had a session last week that fixed this exact bug..."** -- Deep search across all session content. Find any conversation by what was said, not just the title.
- **"What was I working on yesterday?"** -- Continuation intelligence detects unfinished work and generates context prompts to resume instantly.
- **"I have 300+ sessions eating disk space."** -- Stale detection, bulk delete, and health scores help you clean up.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g claude-command-center
claude-command-center
```

### Option 2: From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sorlen008/claude-command-center.git
cd claude-command-center
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5100](http://localhost:5100). Everything is auto-discovered from your `~/.claude/` directory.

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (tested on 20, 22, 24)
- **Claude Code** installed -- the dashboard reads from `~/.claude/` which Claude Code creates
- **git** -- required for the update feature (optional otherwise)

## Features

- **Auto-discovers** all Claude Code projects, MCP servers, skills, plugins, and markdown files
- **Session intelligence** -- deep search across message content, AI summaries, cost analytics, file heatmap, session health scores
- **Operations nerve center** -- real-time service health, cost pacing, attention items, overnight activity
- **Continuation intelligence** -- detects unfinished work, uncommitted changes, abandoned sessions
- **Bash knowledge base** -- every shell command indexed and searchable with success rates and failure hotspots
- **Decision log** -- AI-extracted architectural decisions with alternatives and trade-offs
- **Natural language query** -- ask questions about your analytics data ("Which project costs the most?")
- **Session delegation** -- continue sessions via terminal, Telegram, or voice (cross-platform)
- **Project dashboards** -- per-project cost, health, files, and session aggregation
- **Prompt library** -- save and reuse effective prompt templates
- **Agent tracker** -- definitions and execution history across sessions
- **Live view** -- real-time monitoring with context usage, message counts, and cost estimates
- **Graph visualization** -- interactive ecosystem map with AI-assisted suggestions and `graph-config.yaml`
- **Markdown editor** -- edit `CLAUDE.md` and memory files with version history
- **Discovery** -- finds unconfigured projects and MCP servers on disk
- **One-click updates** -- check and apply updates from the sidebar

## Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Entity counts, health indicators, quick stats |
| **Projects** | Discovered projects with session counts and tech stack |
| **MCP Servers** | Every MCP server found in `.mcp.json` files |
| **Skills** | User-invocable and system skills |
| **Plugins** | Installed and available plugins |

## Session Intelligence

The Sessions page includes a full **Analytics** tab with:

- **Cost Analytics** -- total spend, per-model/project/day breakdowns, most expensive sessions
- **File Heatmap** -- most-touched files with read/edit/write counts, clickable for cross-session timeline
- **Session Health** -- tool error and retry pattern detection (good/fair/poor scoring)
- **Bash Knowledge Base** -- searchable index of every shell command with success rates
- **Decision Log** -- AI-extracted architectural decisions from past sessions
- **Operations Nerve Center** -- configurable service monitoring, cost pacing, attention items
- **Continuation Intelligence** -- unfinished work detection with one-click resume
- **Smart Context Loader** -- generates context prompts from recent session summaries
- **Natural Language Query** -- ask questions about your data using Claude Haiku
- **Prompt Library** -- save reusable templates with one-click copy
- **Weekly Digest** -- automated weekly summary with accomplishments
- **Auto-Workflows** -- configurable auto-summarize, stale detection, cost alerts

## Security and Privacy

**This tool runs entirely on your local machine.**

| Concern | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **File system** | Reads `~/.claude/` and project directories. Writes only to `~/.claude-command-center/` and markdown files you explicitly edit. |
| **Shell commands** | Spawns `claude -p`, `git`, platform file openers, terminal emulators. All user input validated with Zod. |
| **Network** | Binds to `127.0.0.1` only. No outbound requests unless you use Discovery search or AI Suggest. |
| **Data** | All data stored locally as plain JSON. No cloud sync, no external databases. |
| **Telemetry** | None. No analytics, no tracking, no phone-home. |
| **Secrets** | Never stored. Scanned env vars with "secret", "password", "token", "key" are redacted to `***`. |

See [docs/security-threat-model.md](docs/security-threat-model.md) for the full threat model.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `5100` | Server port |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. **Do not set to `0.0.0.0`** -- no authentication. |
| `COMMAND_CENTER_DATA` | `~/.claude-command-center/` | Data directory |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | (none) | Optional. GitHub API rate limits for Discovery. |
| `NERVE_CENTER_SERVICES` | `Command Center:5100` | Services to monitor (`name:port,name:port`). |
| `VOICE_CALLER_SCRIPT` | (disabled) | Path to voice outbound caller script for delegation. |
| `VOICE_PHONE` | (disabled) | Phone number for voice delegation. |

## Graph Configuration

Extend the auto-discovered graph with custom nodes via `graph-config.yaml`:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: my-database
    type: database
    label: "PostgreSQL"
    description: "Primary database on :5432"

edges:
  - source: my-mcp-server
    target: config-my-database
    label: connects_to
```

Place in `~/`, `~/.claude/`, or any project directory. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md#graph-configuration) for details.

**AI Suggest** -- click the button in the graph toolbar to get AI-generated suggestions for infrastructure nodes and connections. Requires Claude Code CLI.

## Building and Updating

```bash
npm run build    # Bundle client (Vite) + server (esbuild)
npm start        # Run production bundle
```

The sidebar shows update indicators. Or manually: `git pull && npm install && npm run build`.
